# Recommendation_System
Create a simple recommendation system that suggests items to
users based on their preferences. You can use techniques like
collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend
movies, books, or products to users.

This code defines a recommendation system that uses collaborative filtering to recommend movies to a specified user based on their preferences and the ratings of similar users. You can modify and extend this code for different types of recommendation systems or with your actual dataset.
